    <h4>Soil conservation:</h4>
    Soil conservation is the prevention of soil loss from erosion or prevention
    of reduced fertility caused by over usage, acidification, salinization or other chemical soil contamination.

    Slash-and-burn and other unsustainable methods of subsistence farming are practiced in some lesser developed
    areas.
    A sequel to the deforestation is typically large scale erosion, loss of soil nutrients and sometimes
    total desertification. Techniques for improved soil conservation include crop rotation, cover crops,
    conservation tillage and planted windbreaks, affect both erosion and fertility. When plants die,
    they decay and become part of the soil. Code 330 defines standard methods recommended by the U.S.
    Natural Resources Conservation Service. Farmers have practiced soil conservation for millennia.
    In Europe, policies such as the Common Agricultural Policy are targeting the application of best
    management practices such as reduced tillage, winter cover crops,[1] plant residues and grass margins
    in order to better address the soil conservation. Political and economic action is further required
    to solve the erosion problem. A simple governance hurdle concerns how we value the land and this
    can be changed by cultural.

    <b>Contour ploughing:</b>
    <br>
    Contour ploughing orients furrows following the contour lines of the farmed area. Furrows move left and right
    to maintain a constant altitude, which reduces runoff. Contour ploughing was practiced by the ancient
    Phoenicians,
    and is effective for slopes between two and ten percent.[3] Contour ploughing can increase crop yields
    from 10 to 50 percent, partially as a result of greater soil retention.

    <br><br>
    <b>Terrace farming:</b>
    <br>
    Terracing is the practice of creating nearly level areas in a hillside area. The terraces form a series of
    steps,
    each at a higher level than the previous. Terraces are protected from erosion by other soil barriers.
    Terraced farming is more common on small farms and in underdeveloped countries, since mechanized
    equipment is difficult to deploy in this setting.
    <br><br>

    <b>Keyline design:</b>
    <br>
    Keyline design is an enhancement of contour farming, where the total watershed
    properties are taken into account in forming the contour lines.

    <br><br>
    <b>Perimeter runoff control:</b>
    <br>
    Tree, shrubs and ground-cover are effective perimeter treatment for soil erosion prevention,
    by impeding surface flows. A special form of this perimeter or inter-row treatment is the
    use of a "grass way" that both channels and dissipates runoff through surface friction,
    impeding surface runoff and encouraging infiltration of the slowed surface water.

    <br><br>
    <b>Windbreaks:</b>
    <br>
    Windbreaks are sufficiently dense rows of trees at the windward exposure of an agricultural field subject
    to wind erosion.[6] Evergreen species provide year-round protection; however, as long as foliage is present
    in the seasons of bare soil surfaces, the effect of deciduous trees may be adequate.

    <br><br>
    <b>Cover crops/crop rotation:</b>
    <br>
    Cover crops such as legumes plant, white turnip, radishes and other species are rotated with cash
    crops to blanket the soil year-round and act as green manure that replenishes nitrogen and other
    critical nutrients. Cover crops also help suppress weeds.

    <br><br>
    <b>Soil-conservation farming:</b>
    <br>
    Soil-conservation farming involves no-till farming, "green manures" and other soil-enhancing practices.
    Such farming methods attempt to mimic the biology of barren lands. They can revive damaged soil, minimize
    erosion,
    encourage plant growth, eliminate the use of nitrogen fertilizer or fungicide, produce above-average yields
    and protect crops during droughts or flooding. The result is less labor and lower costs that increase farmers’
    profits. No-till farming and cover crops act as sinks for nitrogen and other nutrients. This increases the
    amount of soil organic matter.[7]

    Repeated plowing/tilling degrades soil, killing its beneficial fungi and earthworms. Once damaged, soil may take
    multiple
    seasons to fully recover, even in optimal circumstances.[7]

    Critics argue that no-till and related methods are impractical and too expensive for many growers,
    partly because it requires new equipment. They cite advantages for conventional tilling depending on the
    geography,
    crops and soil conditions. Some farmers claimed that no-till complicates weed control, delays planting and
    that post-harvest residues, especially for corn, are hard to manage.[7]

    <b>Salinity management:</b>
    <br>
    Salinity in soil is caused by irrigating with salty water. Water then evaporates from the soil leaving the
    salt behind. Salt breaks down the soil structure, causing infertility and reduced growth.

    The ions responsible for salination are: sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+)
    and chlorine (Cl-). Salinity is estimated to affect about one third of the earth’s arable land.[8] Soil
    salinity adversely affects crop metabolism and erosion usually follows.

    Salinity occurs on drylands from overirrigation and in areas with shallow saline water tables.
    Over-irrigation deposits salts in upper soil layers as a byproduct of soil infiltration; irrigation merely
    increases the rate of salt deposition. The best-known case of shallow saline water table capillary
    action occurred in Egypt after the 1970 construction of the Aswan Dam. The change in the groundwater
    level led to high salt concentrations in the water table. The continuous high level of the water
    table led to soil salination.

    Use of humic acids may prevent excess salination, especially given excessive irrigation.[citation needed] Humic
    acids can fix both anions and cations and eliminate them from root zones.

    <br><br>
    <b>Soil organisms:</b>
    <br>
    When worms excrete feces in the form of casts, a balanced selection of minerals and plant nutrients is made
    into a form accessible for root uptake. Earthworm casts are five times richer in available nitrogen,
    seven times richer in available phosphates and eleven times richer in available potash than the
    surrounding upper 150 millimetres (5.9 in) of soil. The weight of casts produced may be greater
    than 4.5 kg per worm per year. By burrowing, the earthworm improves soil porosity, creating channels
    that enhance the processes of aeration and drainage.[9]

    Other important soil organisms include nematodes, mycorrhiza and bacteria.

    Degraded soil requires synthetic fertilizer to produce high yields. Lacking structure increases erosion
    and carries nitrogen and other pollutants into rivers and streams.[7]

    Each one percent increase in soil organic matter helps soil hold 20,000 gallons more water per acre.

    <br><br>
    <b>Mineralization:</b>
    <br>
    To allow plants full realization of their phytonutrient potential, active mineralization of the soil is
    sometimes undertaken. This can involve adding crushed rock or chemical soil supplements. In either case the
    purpose
    is to combat mineral depletion. A broad range of minerals can be used, including common substances such as
    phosphorus
    and more exotic substances such as zinc and selenium. Extensive research examines the phase transitions
    of minerals in soil with aqueous contact.[10]

    Flooding can bring significant sediments to an alluvial plain. While this effect may not be desirable
    if floods endanger life or if the sediment originates from productive land, this process of addition to a
    floodplain is a natural process that can rejuvenate soil chemistry through mineralization.
